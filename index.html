            <p>Every morning, little Alex woke up to the smell of warm toast and his mother's gentle smile. She would pack his lunch with care, adding a little note that said, "You are loved!" Alex lived with his mom in a cozy house filled with laughter and warmth.</p>

            <p>At school, Alex noticed something that made his heart feel heavy. When the bell rang at the end of the day, he watched other children run into the arms of both their mothers and fathers. They looked so happy together, like complete families.</p>

            <p>One rainy afternoon, Alex sat by his window watching the raindrops race down the glass. His parents had divorced when he was younger, and sometimes he felt like something was missing. A small tear rolled down his cheek as he wondered why his family was different.</p>

            <p>That evening, Mom noticed Alex was quiet. She knelt down beside him, held his hands gently, and looked into his eyes. "Alex," she said softly, "families come in all shapes and sizes. What matters most is the love we share. You are never alone—I am here, and I will always be here for you."</p>
